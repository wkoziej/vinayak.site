## Architecture Overview

This is an Eleventy (11ty) static site built for a multi-service business website. The site uses Nunjucks templating with Bootstrap for styling.

**Key Structure:**
- `src/` - Source files for the website
- `src/_data/` - Global data files (site configuration, navigation)
- `src/_includes/layouts/base.njk` - Main layout template with Bootstrap integration
- `src/_includes/partials/` - Reusable template components (header, footer)
- `src/assets/` - Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- `dist/` - Built output directory (generated by Eleventy)

**Configuration:**
- `.eleventy.js` - Eleventy configuration with asset passthrough and filters
- Input directory: `src/`
- Output directory: `dist/`
- Template formats: Nunjucks (.njk), Markdown, HTML

**Deployment:**
- GitHub Actions workflow deploys to GitHub Pages on push to `main`
- Includes workarounds for npm package issues in CI environment
- Site builds from `dist/` folder

**Content Management:**
- Site metadata in `src/_data/site.json`
- Navigation structure in `src/_data/navigation.json` 
- Pages are `.njk` files in `src/` root
- Uses Bootstrap 5.3.2 via CDN with custom CSS overlay

The site serves as a business card for Ayurvedic Journey, offering authentic Ayurvedic treatments including Prana Yog, Marma Therapy, Panchakarma treatments, and 14-day Himalayan Panchakarma Tours.
